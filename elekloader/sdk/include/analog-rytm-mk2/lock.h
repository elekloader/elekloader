/* core-ar2 0.8: lockable mod parameters (docs/ADAPTING.md, "Lockable
 * parameters (core-ar2 0.8, Analog Rytm MKII)").
 *
 * A sound-scope storage field declared with "lock": true gets a lock code
 * (42..127) from the build's lockfile. A mod registers it once, through the
 * table core_lock_params:
 *
 *     "storage": [{"sym": "my_depth", "scope": "sound", "bits": 7, "lock": true}],
 *     "contribute": [
 *       {"to": "core_lock_params", "order": 50, "data": "00000000",
 *        "relocs": [[0, "abs32", "sym:my_depth_param", 0]]}]
 *
 * and in C:
 *
 *     STORE_FIELD(my_depth);
 *     const struct core_lock_param my_depth_param =
 *         {STORE(my_depth), 449, 0, 127, "DEP", "My Depth", CORE_LOCK_CATEGORY("MINE")};
 *
 * Core then lists the parameter in each sound's LFO destination menu (after
 * stock's, as category:name, "MOD" when the category is 0), names it there
 * and in the DST value, and keeps the LFO's offset
 * for it, which the mod reads with core_lfo_offset and adds to the value it
 * uses. With id, the page knob that shows the parameter (core_params),
 * RANDOMIZE PAGE gives the knob a value in min..max and RELOAD PAGE takes it
 * back from the saved kit, as they do stock knobs.
 *
 * core-ar2 0.9: a kit-scope field can be lockable too. It is the FX track's
 * (track 12) parameter: listed in the FX LFO's destination menu, p-locked on
 * the FX track, locked in scenes and performances there, on MIDI on the FX
 * track's channel, and read with track 12 in the calls below. It cannot be a
 * velocity or aftertouch destination ("mod"): the FX track has no routes.
