"""+Drive storage: the boot allocator's twin and /mods/.store (docs/DRIVE.md, "+Drive storage").

A +Drive mod's storage fields live in the same bytes as the flashed build's, so a save, write-through,
Total Recall, SysEx and library sounds carry them with nothing new. Only the placement moves from build
time to boot: the Drive Loader places the +Drive fields in the bits each scope of the flashed build
leaves free, and keeps where it put them in /mods/.store. This module is that allocator on the computer,
rule for rule, so the loader (mods/drive-loader-ar2) and the host give the same placements and the same
.store bytes for the same inputs.

What the allocator reads from the flashed build is only what the unit can read at boot (Base): each
scope's room, bits used and generation (the descriptor's storage record); the layout ID and its ancestors
(core_store_ids); the lock codes, CCs and inits the build gives its own fields (core_lock_codes,
core_lock_ccs, core_field_inits). The build's lockfile trailer is not read: nothing on the unit reads it.

The rules mirror elekloader/store.py's, turned to face the flashed build:

- the pool of a scope is its bits from the build's used bits up to its room: bits no flashed field has
  ever used. +Drive fields are placed from the room's top down, so a later flashed build that grows from
  its used bits up meets them as late as it can;
- a field keeps its bits while its mod declares it with the same scope, width and init;
- a field no chosen mod declares any more is parked: it keeps its bits and its values, the core counts
  it as owned (so a save without the mod keeps them), and its mod gets them back when it returns. Only
  FORGET DATA (forget()) drops a parked field;
- any other new field takes never-used bits from the scope's low mark down. When they run out, the
  scope is repacked: its generation goes up, its parked fields are dropped and its fields are packed again
  from the room's top, in (mod id, symbol) order. Projects and sounds saved before then load the scope at
  defaults, the flashed fields' too: the core keeps one generation a scope;
- the same repack happens when the flashed build changes under a field: a new generation of the scope
  (a flashed repack), a field below the build's used bits (the flashed build grew into it) or past its
  room (a core with less room);
- lock codes come from the top of the device's range down (127, 126, ...), past every code the flashed
  build uses; a field keeps its code while it keeps its place, a parked field's code is kept for it, and
  only when the codes above the build's highest are gone is the code freed longest ago given out again.
  A code the flashed build has taken since is given up;
- CCs come from the device's pool from its end, past the build's own; a field keeps its CC wherever it
  is placed, a parked field's CC is kept for it until the never-used CCs run out;
- the live layout ID is the flashed layout's ID while the .store holds nothing and no generation moved;
  otherwise the first 4 bytes of a SHA-256 of the flashed ID, each scope's generation and every field
  (parked ones too) and lock code (layout_id). A park or a return changes no bit, so it keeps the ID. The
  .store keeps the last 15 live IDs before this one: they and the flashed build's lineage are the
  ancestors the core reads data from.

fit() decides which mods the room refuses (the last in id order, again until the set fits), before
allocate() places a set that fits. Nothing here reads a clock or iterates in hash order.

/mods/.store (format 1; big-endian, every record 4-byte aligned):

  +0x00 'DLST'; +0x04 u16 format, u16 0; +0x08 u32 size; +0x0c u32 CRC-32 (zlib's) of the file with
  this word zero; +0x10 u32 the flashed layout ID it was written for, u32 the live layout ID;
  +0x18 u8 next code, u8 ID count, then u16 counts of fields, parked fields, codes, freed codes, CCs and
  freed CCs, u16 0; +0x28 per scope (sound, kit, global, track, pattern, project), 8 bytes: u8 the
  flashed generation it was written for, u8 the live generation, u16 0, u32 the low mark (the lowest bit
  the +Drive has given out since the scope's last repack; its room when none);
  then the IDs (u32 each, newest first); the fields, then the parked fields (by scope, then offset;
  parked in the order they were parked): u8 scope (1..6), u8 bits, u16 offset, u32 init, u8 mod id's
  length, u8 symbol's length, u16 0, the two names' bytes, zeros to 4; the codes (by code), then the
  freed codes (freed longest ago first): u8 code, u8 and u8 the names' lengths, u8 0, the names, zeros to
  4; the CCs (by CC), then the freed CCs, likewise with the CC.

A file that is missing, cut short, of another format or with a wrong CRC reads as none: a fresh
placement, and the items then load those scopes at defaults.
